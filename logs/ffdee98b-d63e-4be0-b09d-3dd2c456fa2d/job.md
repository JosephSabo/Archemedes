Deploy thepopebot as a systemd service by executing the complete migration process. First run the diagnostic scripts to identify current processes, then safely stop any existing thepopebot instances, configure the environment variables, install the systemd service, and start it. Use the migration tools that were created in the previous jobs. Ensure proper backup of current configuration and provide rollback instructions. Test the service after installation and verify it's working correctly. Document the entire deployment process and final status.
